## Hybrid Breeding

Create unique flower hybrids by breeding flowers together! Breeding is now a passive, time-based process.

### How to Breed

1. Place compatible flowers next to each other (within 1 block, including diagonals)
2. **Wait** - breeding happens automatically over time
3. After **1-10 minutes**, a new flower will spawn in an adjacent empty space

**Breeding Timing:**
- **Minimum wait**: 1 minute before any breeding can occur
- **Maximum wait**: 10 minutes (guaranteed breeding by this point)
- Between 1-10 minutes, breeding chance increases gradually

**Breeding Results (50/50 chance):**
- **50% chance**: Produces the hybrid flower
- **50% chance**: Produces a copy of one of the parent flowers

**Requirements:**
- Flowers must be adjacent (including diagonals)
- There must be an empty space nearby for the offspring to spawn
- The ground below must be valid (grass, dirt, podzol, farmland, moss, etc.)
- Timers persist through world saves, server restarts, and player disconnects

### Duplicating Hybrid Flowers

Once you've bred a hybrid flower, you can **duplicate it using bone meal**!

- Right-click a hybrid flower with bone meal
- A copy of that flower will spawn in an adjacent empty space
- Only hybrid flowers respond to bone meal (base flowers do not)

- **Duplicate hybrids with bone meal** - Once you have a hybrid, use bone meal to quickly grow more
- **Triple combos need all three flowers adjacent** - For Sunrise Pansies and Manhattan Lights Lupine
- **Same flower breeding** - Place two White Lupines next to each other for Golden Lupine
- **Breed in the dark** to unlock Halloween variants (light level 4 or below)
- **Bone meal Blanketflowers** to grow them through their 4 stages
- **Bees love these flowers!** All flowers work with bees for pollination
